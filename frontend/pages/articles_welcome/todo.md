            We did everything to make flashcard creation pleasant for you.

            <p>
              We implement a variation of an <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm">SM2</a> algorithm for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>.<br/>
              It's based on repeating something you want to learn in ever increasing inervals.<br/>
              <b>We learn the best when we just begin to forget</b>, and our purpose is to make you review your flashcards at the best timing.

              First review will happen in about 4 hours, next one in 24 hours, next in 3 days and so on.
