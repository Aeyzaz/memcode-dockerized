# so about twitter sex talk - I don't mind them talking of sex as far as it's smart (pervocracy is talking of sex all the time).
# typical vk girl would be dumbly and patriarchaly talking of relationahips, typical vk boy would be dumbly and patriarchaly talking of sex and status. there is no much difference to me while they talk dumbly.
# and I'm very clueless about twitter dynamics, hard to imagine typical girl that talks dumbly of sex while typical male talking smartly about everything else. but this could very well be local dynamic, why not. just need to see it.
