___how to make www.memcode.com (simple memcode.com already works) redirect to https://www.memcode.com?
   Google Domains support told me it must be done specifically via the heroku server, and heroku has this page: https://help.heroku.com/J2R1S4T8/can-heroku-force-an-application-to-use-ssl-tls.

___is it possible to have everything redirect to https://memcode.com, without www?
   Google Domains support: `Jerry 10:14PM - Well, unfortunately, Heroku needs www to properly set up the pointing. On the other hand, you may ask Heroku if we can just point it to your website using an IP so we can only set up the A records.`,
   so seemingly it's not possible.
