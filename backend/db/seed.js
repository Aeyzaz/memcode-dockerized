// shallow Shallow rendering is useful to constrain yourself to testing a component as a unit, and to ensure that your tests aren't indirectly asserting on behavior of child components.

// mount Full DOM rendering is ideal for use cases where you have components that may interact with DOM APIs, or may require the full lifecycle in order to fully test the component (i.e., componentDidMount etc.)

// Enzyme's render function is used to render react components to static HTML and analyze the resulting HTML structure.




// async Essentially wraps the return value of the function in a promise

// event loop looks at the stack, and, if there is nothing left, pushes the first thing into it.

// maps. are just like js objects, except everything can be a key.

// a.has('hi') //=> true
// a.add('hi') //=> nothing changes, set is nonrepeating.

// Human memory works to combat complex memories by means of forgetting, replacement connections, interference, abstraction, etc. As forgetting and interference target complex memories, Darwinian mechanisms favor simple abstractions that are cheap to maintain and serve more efficient computation. That aspect of forgetting underlies human intelligence and creativity!
